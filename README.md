##  üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª Usage

The landing page to the users is shown below:

<ul>
  <li>Users can either upload PDFs from local system using Upload button or can give link to an online article (not functional yet)</li>
  <li>Then user has to click <strong>Submit</strong> button for the processing of the files.</li>
  <li>After first two steps, users will be directly guided to the respective endpoints of the conversation which they can switch anytime with the others in the navbar on the left.</li>
  <li>An acronym for the files the users have uploaded will be shown near on top near the link input. Upon submitting a file, submit and uploads are disabled.</li>
</ul>

Upon uploading the interface generally looks like as shown below, then the user has to sumbit the documents/links:

Then the user's can ask questions in the space provided below related to the uploaded documents. Or can switch to any other conversation or can even delete the conversations.

##  üè∞ Architecture

  ### Frontend (React)
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Interface</strong>: Provides an interactive and responsive interface for users to upload PDFs, interact with the chatbot, and navigate conversation history.</li>
    <li><strong>State Management</strong>: Utilizes state management via Context API to manage application state.</li>
  </ul>

  ### Backend (FastAPI)
  <ul>
    <li><strong>API Endpoints</strong>: Exposes RESTful API endpoints for handling PDF uploads, user queries, and managing conversation history.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Processing</strong>: Processing the content of PDFs, embedding for vector database and interfaces with the LangChain models to generate responses.</li>
  </ul>

  ### Database (SQLite)
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data Storage</strong>: Stores user data, conversation history, and metadata related to the uploaded PDF files.</li>
    <li><strong>ORM</strong>: Uses SQLAlchemy for object-relational mapping, for more intutive database interaction.</li>
  </ul>

  ### File Storage (LocalStorage)
  <ul>
    <li><strong>File Management</strong>: Saves uploaded PDF files locally with systematic organization to prevent file collisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability Considerations</strong>: Provides availability for future transitioning to cloud storage solutions like AWS S3 if needed.</li>
  </ul>

  ### Natural Language Processing (LangChain)
  <ul>
    <li><strong>LLM Integration</strong>: Leverages LangChain for advanced natural language understanding and response generation.</li>
  </ul>

  ### Workflow
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Interaction</strong>: Users interact with the chatbot via the React frontend, uploading PDFs and asking questions.</li>
    <li><strong>API Requests</strong>: The frontend sends requests to the FastAPI backend to process these interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Processing</strong>: The backend processes the PDF content and queries using LangChain's LLMs to generate appropriate responses.</li>
    <li><strong>Response Delivery</strong>: The backend sends the responses back to the frontend, which displays them to the user.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Storage</strong>: All interactions and conversation history are stored in SQLite, and uploaded files are saved in LocalStorage as vector database for semantic search.</li>
  </ul>

##  ‚òÅÔ∏è API Endpoints
